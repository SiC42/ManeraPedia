# ManeraPedia
An attempt to write a Wiki which has access controls, i.e. a given article can only be viewed (and edited) by those who have the rights to do so.

The wiki uses ElasticSearch as a backend, python-flask as the middleware, which handles the acccess control, and the frontend is powered by React.

The development is still in progress.
Currently a user can access all articles and edit them via a customized Markdown. However, as of now the wiki does not support creating new articles.
